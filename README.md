## Parts

    - Part 1 : 
        Fib Memoization
        write a function 'fib(n)' that takes in a number as an argument-
        The function should return the n-th number of Fibonacci sequence.

    - Part 2 :
        Grid Traveler
        Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left
        corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner.
        You may only move down or right.
        In how many way you can travel to the goal on a grid with
        dimensions m * n?
        Write a function 'gridTraveler(m, n)' that calculates this

    - Part 3 :
        Can Sum
        Write a function 'canSum(targetSum, numbers)' that takes in a 
        targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.
        The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is
        possible to generate the targetSum using th numbers from the array.
        You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
        You may assume that all input numbers are non-negative.

    - Part 4 :
        How Sum
        Write a function 'howSum(targetSum, numbers)' that takes in a 
        targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.
        The function should return an array containing any combination of
        elements that add up to exactly the targetSum. If there is no 
        combination that adds up to the targeSum return null.
        If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any
        single one.

    - Part 5 : Tabulation
