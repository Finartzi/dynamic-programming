## Parts

    - Part 1 : 
        Fib Memoization
        write a function 'fib(n)' that takes in a number as an argument-
        The function should return the n-th number of Fibonacci sequence.

    - Part 2 :
        Grid Traveler
        Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left
        corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner.
        You may only move down or right.
        In how many way you can travel to the goal on a grid with
        dimensions m * n?
        Write a function 'gridTraveler(m, n)' that calculates this

    - Part 3 : Tabulation
