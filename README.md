## Parts

### Part 1

    Fib Memoization
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=210s>
    write a function 'fib(n)' that takes in a number as an argument-
    The function should return the n-th number of Fibonacci sequence.

### Part 2

    Grid Traveler
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=2319s>
    Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left
    corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner.
    You may only move down or right.
    In how many way you can travel to the goal on a grid with
    dimensions m * n?
    Write a function 'gridTraveler(m, n)' that calculates this

### Part 3

    Can Sum
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=4196s>
    Write a function 'canSum(targetSum, numbers)' that takes in a 
    targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.
    The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is
    possible to generate the targetSum using th numbers from the array.
    You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
    You may assume that all input numbers are non-negative.

### Part 4

    How Sum
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=5369s>
    Write a function 'howSum(targetSum, numbers)' that takes in a 
    targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.
    The function should return an array containing any combination of
    elements that add up to exactly the targetSum. If there is no 
    combination that adds up to the targeSum return null.
    If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any
    single one.

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=6726s>
    Write a function 'bestSum(targetSum, numbers)' that takes in a 
    targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.
    The function should return an array containing the shortest
    combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.
    If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any
    one of the shortest.

    Write a function 'canConstruct(target, wordBank)' that accepts a 
    target string and an array of strings.
    The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not 'target'
    can be constructed by concatenating elements of the 'wordBank' array.

    target string and an array of strings.
    The function should return a number of ways that the 'target' can be
    constructed by concatenating elements of the 'wordBank' array.
    You may reuse the elements of the 'wordBank' as many times as needed.

### Part 8

    All Construct
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=10050s>
    Write a function 'allConstruct(target, wordBank)' that accepts a 
    target string and an array of strings.
    The function should return a 2D array containing all of the ways that
    the 'target' can be constructed by concatenating elements of the 'wordBank' 
    array.
    Each element of the 2D array should represent one combination that constructs
    the 'target'.
    You may reuse the elements of the 'wordBank' as many times as needed.

    Fib tabulation
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=11453s>
    write a function 'fib(n)' that takes in a number as an argument-
    The function should return the n-th number of Fibonacci sequence.

## Memoization Recipe

    1. Make it work
        - visualize the problem as a tree
        - implement the tree using recursion
        - test it
  
    2. Make it efficient
        - add a memo object
        - add a base case to return memo values

## Tabulation Recipe

    - visualize the problem as a table
    - size the table based on the inputs
    - initialize the table with default values
    - seed the trivial answer into the table
    - iterate through the table
    - fill further positions based on the current position
  
## Dynamic Programming
    - notice any overlapping subproblems
    - decide what is the trivially smallest input
    - think recursively to use Memoization or
    - think iteratively to use Tabulation
    - draw a strategy first!!!
